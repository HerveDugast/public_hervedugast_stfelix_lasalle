       defines an attribute daemon_threads, which indicates whether or not the server should wait 
       for thread termination. We should set the flag explicitly if we would like threads to 
       behave autonomously. The default value is False, meaning that Python will not exit 
       until all threads created by ThreadingMixIn have exited. In the code, we set it True, 
       which means Python will exit the server thread when the main thread terminates not waiting
